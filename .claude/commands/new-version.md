Update to version  #$ARGUMENTS in all files which are responsible for version handling and check the code to ensure you change in every possible place. There is version.txt but there are also version macro used in the game to show the current version. 
Update also version in all the packages related files.

When creating pre or dev version dont update the changelos - changelogs etc we fill just with full version (without pre alpha beta dev pre postfixes).
