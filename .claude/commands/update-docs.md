Update the docs based on the current source code, identify the changes in the code which are not documented etc. Don't use emoji, just fact, without excited language.

There must be a folder ai-docs/final-docs/

with documentation files. in each file give the head with id from which commit knowledge is extracted or update so you know if this needs to be updated:

* particles.md
* game_states.md
* sprites.md how sprites which one are being used cut etc
* animation-diamonds-before-game.md
* music.md including which tracks are used
* sound.md how the sound and which samples
