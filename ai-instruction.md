# 🎯 Goals

This repository contains the DeerPortal SFML game, developed by you! 🦌

Our primary objective is to migrate this project to **SFML 3.0.0** (from its current version). You can find the SFML 3.0.0 download here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/3.0.0/

# 🛠️ Development Guidelines

We are developing this on macOS, but the final product should also work seamlessly on Linux and Windows. 💻

We are using CMake (preferably the latest version) to build the project. ⚙️

Always adopt a **systematic approach**. 🤔 Think ahead about which other files might be affected by changes. After a maximum of **7 tool calls**, please pause to perform a systematic analysis. Look at the latest errors, and try to predict if similar issues might occur in files that haven't been compiled yet. Conduct proactive analysis every 5 such steps.

A helpful analysis of how the game works, which is beneficial for the migration, is available in `game-ai-analysis.md`. 📄
