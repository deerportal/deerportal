# DeerPortal 0.9.1 "Stability Improvements" - Welcome Back!

After several years of inactivity, I'm thrilled to announce the return of DeerPortal! In 2025, the Almighty Deer God has blessed me with renewed energy and inspiration. In a meanwhile FML - the main game engine powering DeerPortal - released version 3.0, requiring a complete migration of my codebase. I'm excited to present DeerPortal 0.9.1 with numerous improvements and modernizations.

## Development Journey

The game went into hiatus during the COVID-19 pandemic around 2020. In January 2025, I started the rewriting process to migrate to SFML 3, but initially failed. I tried again in April/May with much better progress. After that, I worked on optimizations and improved the build process. I reviewed comments from various players across the internet and realized that people didn't understand how to play the game. So I wrote a proper handbook and added a message layer in the game to better explain what's happening.

I also reviewed and improved the CI/CD infrastructure for building across various platforms, which should help keep development up to date going forward.

Some development statistics:

- **Development Period**: October 15, 2019 ‚Üí July 13, 2025 (5 years, 9 months)
