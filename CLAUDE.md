# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DeerPortal is a hybrid board/card game built with SFML 3.0 and C++17. It's a cross-platform game supporting 0-4 players with AI opponents, featuring elemental mechanics and card-based gameplay.

**Current Version: 0.9.3 "CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement"**  
**Technology Stack: SFML 3.0.1, CMake, C++17**  
**Code Quality: A Grade (91/100) - Professional implementation**

## Build Commands

### Primary Build System (CMake)
```bash
# Configure for Release (recommended)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

# Configure for Debug (development)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .

# Enable FPS counter in Release build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSHOW_FPS_COUNTER=ON .

# Build executable
make

# Create platform packages
make package         # Cross-platform packages
make dmg            # macOS DMG installer  
make install        # Install to system
```

### Version Management
- **Single source of truth**: `version.txt` contains current version
- **Manual updates required**: `snapcraft.yaml`, `net.devcarpet.deerportal.appdata.xml`, `debian/changelog` when releasing
- **Runtime display**: Version appears in-game with build type and base path

### Dependencies
- **SFML 3.0.1** (found via CMake if installed via Homebrew)
- **CMake 3.16+**
- **C++17 compatible compiler** (Clang++ 14+, GCC 9+, MSVC 2019+)

## Code Architecture

### Modular Design
The game uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **GameCore** (`src/game-core.h/cpp`) - Game logic, state management, player turns
- **GameAssets** (`src/game-assets.h/cpp`) - Asset loading, menu system, resource management
- **GameInput** (`src/game-input.h/cpp`) - Unified event processing, context-aware input handling
- **GameRenderer** (`src/game-renderer.h/cpp`) - V-Sync optimized rendering pipeline and graphics
- **GameStateManager** (`src/game-state-manager.h/cpp`) - State transitions and music coordination
- **Main Game Class** (`src/game.h/cpp`) - Central coordinator with modular architecture

### Key Technical Details
- **Memory Management**: Modern C++ RAII with `std::unique_ptr` for SFML objects
- **Asset Management**: Multi-platform path resolution (macOS bundles, AppImage APPDIR, Windows relative)
- **Input System**: Unified event processing with context-aware Escape behavior (Gameâ†’Menuâ†’Exit)
- **Performance**: V-Sync optimization (CPU: 75% â†’ 15-25%), VertexArray diamond rendering
- **Shaders**: Custom GLSL shaders for blur, pixelation, and intro animations
- **Card System**: 128 cards with unified 4-second notification delay for all player types

### File Structure
```

```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **C++17**: Use modern C++ features, smart pointers, RAII
- **SFML 3.0**: Follow SFML 3.0 patterns and API
- **Code Formatting**: LLVM style enforced via clang-format (see `.clang-format`)
- **Naming Conventions**: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes/types
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces, no tabs, 100-character line limit
- **Pointers**: Left alignment (`int* ptr`, `const std::string& ref`)
- **Includes**: Sorted and grouped (standard â†’ SFML â†’ project headers)
- **Header Dependencies**: Use forward declarations where possible, full includes only for direct members
- **Memory Safety**: Prefer `std::unique_ptr` for SFML objects

### Testing
- **No formal unit testing framework** - uses integration testing through CI/CD
- **Test mode**: Run with `--test` flag for basic testing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with 3-platform matrix builds (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS Apple Silicon)
- **Workflow Consistency**: cmake.yml (PR/CI) and test-release.yml unified for identical behavior
- **Release Pipeline**: Robust duplicate detection and conflict resolution (July 2025 fixes)

## Development Environment

### Cursor IDE Rules
The project includes Cursor IDE rules in `.cursor/rules/`:
- **sfml31.mdc**: Ensures SFML 3.0.1 API usage consistency
- **gitignore.mdc**: Maintains proper .gitignore file updates

When using Cursor IDE, these rules will automatically apply to ensure:
- Correct SFML 3.0.1 API calls (e.g., `font.openFromFile()` not `loadFromFile()`)
- Updated .gitignore for temporary files and build artifacts

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS
- **App Bundle**: Professional packaging with proper icon and metadata
- **DMG Creation**: `make dmg` creates installer with Applications symlink
- **Code Signing**: Configured for macOS security compatibility
- **Dependencies**: SFML bundled in app bundle for distribution

### Linux
- **Debian Packages**: `fakeroot debian/rules binary` for local .deb creation
- **Snap Package**: Available via snapcraft.yaml (manual version updates)
- **AppImage**: Cross-distribution portable format support

### Windows  
- **NSIS Installer**: Windows installer package creation
- **Cross-Compilation**: MXE toolchain support for Linuxâ†’Windows builds
- **Visual Studio**: CMakeSettings.json for native Windows development

## Writing Guidelines

### Content Style
- **Language Goal**: Write blog posts naturally, simply, and concisely
- **Writing Approach**: 
  - Focus on facts
  - Avoid overly generous AI-style writing
  - Eliminate unnecessary jokes or elaborate language
  - Prioritize clarity and directness
  - Dont assume if players like game, dont show off etc, dont assume that anything is good, just provide facts.
  - If something is not fact, dont write about this.
