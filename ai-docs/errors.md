## July 19, 2025 - Linux Distribution Asset Loading (v0.9.6)

**Problem**: AppImage and tar.gz Linux distributions failed to start due to asset path issues:
- AppImage: `execv error: No such file or directory` 
- Tar.gz: `Failed to open sound file - assets/audio/dice.ogg`

**Root Cause**: 
- AppImage CI installed assets to `/usr/share/deerportal/` but code expected `/usr/share/games/deerportal/`
- Tar.gz packages had assets in correct location but binary couldn't resolve relative paths

**Solution**:
1. Updated `filetools.h` APPDIR path resolution to use `/usr/share/games/deerportal/`
2. Added Linux-specific binary detection using `/proc/self/exe` and `readlink`
3. Fixed CI workflows (cmake.yml, test-release.yml, release.yml) to install assets in `/usr/share/games/deerportal/`
4. Added stat() verification to ensure assets directory exists before using path

**Files Modified**: 
- `src/filetools.h` - Asset path resolution logic
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` - CI/CD asset installation paths

**Testing**: Requires building new Linux packages to verify fixes work in actual distribution environment.

## Issue: Game state persistence bug when returning from menu (FIXED in 0.9.5)
- Symptom: When pressing Escape to menu then clicking to play, game continued from previous state
- Cause: GameStateManager::showGameBoard() didn't call restartGame() when transitioning from menu
- Players/resources/positions persisted inappropriately instead of resetting
- Fix: Added single line `game->restartGame()` in src/game-state-manager.cpp:109
- Status: âœ… RESOLVED in version 0.9.5

## Issue: LICENSE missing from Windows installer/search
- Cause: Not included in qmake/CMake packaging steps.
- Fix: Added LICENSE to OTHER_FILES, DISTFILES, and CMake install. To be verified in 0.9.2-pre.1. 

## Issue: PowerShell execution policy error when running .exe files
- Symptom: Error message "The term '.\DeerPortal-0.9.5-Windows.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program"
- Cause: Windows PowerShell execution policy treats .exe files as scripts in some configurations
- Status: Application still runs correctly despite the error message
- Solutions:
  1. Use Command Prompt instead: `cmd /c "DeerPortal-0.9.5-Windows.exe"`
  2. Use full path: `& ".\DeerPortal-0.9.5-Windows.exe"`
  3. Change execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
  4. Run via Start-Process: `Start-Process ".\DeerPortal-0.9.5-Windows.exe"`
