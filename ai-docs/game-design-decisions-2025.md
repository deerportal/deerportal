# DeerPortal Game Design Decisions - 2025 Update

## Overview

This document captures the key design decisions, architectural choices, and recent improvements made to DeerPortal as of July 2025. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the current state of the game's design and implementation.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Modular Game Architecture

**Decision**: Split game functionality into distinct, focused modules
**Implementation**: 5 core modules with clear separation of concerns

```cpp
// Main game coordination
Game (src/game.cpp/h)
├── GameAssets (src/game-assets.cpp/h)     // Asset loading & management
├── GameInput (src/game-input.cpp/h)      // Input processing & events
├── GameRenderer (src/game-renderer.cpp/h) // Rendering & graphics
├── GameCore (src/game-core.cpp/h)        // Game logic & rules
└── GameStateManager (src/game-state-manager.cpp/h) // State transitions
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy testing and debugging
- Maintainable codebase structure
- Performance optimization opportunities

### 2. Technology Stack Choices

**Graphics Library**: SFML 3.0.1
- **Rationale**: Modern C++ API, cross-platform compatibility, active development
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated rendering with V-Sync optimization
- **Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux support

**Build System**: CMake 3.16+
- **Cross-platform**: Unified build system across all platforms
- **Package Management**: Automated dependency handling
- **Asset Management**: Platform-specific asset bundling

**Language Standard**: C++17
- **Modern Features**: Smart pointers, RAII patterns, auto type deduction
- **Memory Safety**: std::unique_ptr for SFML objects
- **Performance**: Compile-time optimizations

## Input System Design

### 3. Unified Event Processing (2025 Update)

**Decision**: Centralize all input handling through GameInput module
**Previous Issue**: Fragmented event handling across multiple files
**Current Implementation**: Single event processing pipeline

```cpp
// Unified event flow
input->processEvents(window) →
├── handleKeyboardInput() → F11, Escape, etc.
├── handleMouseInput() → Clicks, interactions
└── updateSelector() → Mouse position tracking
```

**Key Features**:
- **Context-Aware Escape**: Game→Menu→Exit progression
- **Multiple Fullscreen Keys**: F, F11, Cmd+Enter (macOS)
- **Consistent Event Handling**: No duplicate processing

### 4. Performance-Optimized Rendering

**Decision**: V-Sync only approach for frame rate control
**Previous Issue**: Conflicting frame rate settings causing 75% CPU usage
**Current Implementation**: Clean V-Sync synchronization

```cpp
// Optimized rendering
window.setVerticalSyncEnabled(true);  // Sync to monitor refresh rate
// No manual frame rate limiting to avoid conflicts
```

**Benefits**:
- CPU usage reduced from 75% to 15-25%
- Adaptive performance (60Hz/120Hz/144Hz monitors)
- Eliminated screen tearing
- Lower power consumption

## Asset Management Architecture

### 5. Multi-Platform Asset Loading

**Decision**: Flexible asset path resolution with environment detection
**Implementation**: Hierarchical path resolution system

```cpp
// Asset path priority
1. DP_DIR environment variable (override)
2. APPDIR environment variable (AppImage)
3. macOS app bundle detection
4. Relative path fallback
```

**Platform Support**:
- **macOS**: App bundle Resources/ directory
- **Linux**: Standard /usr/share/deerportal/ location
- **Windows**: Relative to executable
- **AppImage**: APPDIR-based resolution

### 6. Professional Error Handling

**Decision**: SafeAssetLoader with graceful fallbacks
**Implementation**: Multiple search paths and error recovery

```cpp
// Search paths with fallbacks
".", "./assets", "../assets", "./Resources", "../Resources"
// Graceful fallback to system fonts when game fonts fail
```

## Game Logic Architecture

### 7. Card Notification System

**Decision**: Unified timing for all player types
**Previous Issue**: Human players could skip notifications instantly
**Current Implementation**: 4-second delay for all players

```cpp
// Consistent notification timing
game.cardNotificationDelay = game.CARD_NOTIFICATION_DELAY_TIME; // 4 seconds
// Applies to both human and computer players
```

**User Experience**:
- Equal notification viewing time
- Consistent game flow
- Prevents accidental skipping

### 8. State Management System

**Decision**: Centralized state management with clear transitions
**Implementation**: GameStateManager with music coordination

```cpp
// Game states
state_menu → state_setup_players → state_lets_begin → 
state_roll_dice → state_game → state_gui_end_round → state_end_game
```

**Features**:
- State-aware input handling
- Automatic music transitions
- Context-sensitive UI rendering

## Cross-Platform Distribution

### 9. Universal Linux Support via AppImage

**Decision**: Add AppImage as third Linux distribution format
**Implementation**: Standard Linux application structure

```bash
# AppImage structure
DeerPortal.AppDir/
├── usr/bin/DeerPortal
├── usr/share/deerportal/assets/
└── usr/share/applications/net.devcarpet.deerportal.desktop
```

**Distribution Methods**:
1. **macOS**: DMG installer with app bundle
2. **Windows**: NSIS installer with Start Menu integration
3. **Linux DEB**: Debian/Ubuntu package manager
4. **Linux TGZ**: Universal archive
5. **Linux AppImage**: Portable single-file execution

### 10. CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**Decision**: Three-tier workflow system
**Implementation**: Comprehensive testing and release automation

```yaml
# Workflow structure
cmake.yml:        # Continuous Integration (every commit)
test-release.yml: # Pre-release validation (manual)
release.yml:      # Production releases (tagged)
```

**Features**:
- Cross-platform matrix builds (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Automated asset packaging
- Smart upload system with conflict resolution
- PDF handbook generation

## Code Quality Standards

### 11. LLVM Coding Standards

**Decision**: Enforce consistent C++ style across codebase
**Implementation**: .clang-format with LLVM style

```cpp
// Code style standards
- camelCase for functions/variables
- PascalCase for classes/types
- 2 spaces indentation, no tabs
- 100-character line limit
- Left-aligned pointers (int* ptr)
```

**Quality Metrics**:
- Current Grade: A (91/100)
- Continuous improvement tracking
- Automated formatting enforcement

### 12. Memory Management Strategy

**Decision**: Modern C++ RAII patterns with smart pointers
**Implementation**: std::unique_ptr for SFML objects

```cpp
// Memory safety patterns
std::unique_ptr<sf::Texture> texture;
std::unique_ptr<sf::Sprite> sprite;
// Automatic cleanup, no manual memory management
```

## Window Management Design

### 13. Professional Fullscreen Implementation

**Decision**: SFML 3.0.1 window recreation pattern
**Implementation**: WindowManager with state preservation

```cpp
// Fullscreen toggle process
1. Save window position and properties
2. Close current window
3. Create new window with fullscreen style
4. Restore properties (V-Sync, position)
```

**Features**:
- Multiple key bindings (F, F11, Cmd+Enter)
- State preservation across toggles
- Error recovery with fallback to windowed mode

## Recent Architectural Improvements (July 2025)

### 14. Event System Unification

**Problem Solved**: Fragmented input handling causing missed events
**Solution**: Single GameInput event processing pipeline
**Impact**: Reliable F11 fullscreen, proper Escape behavior, working mouse clicks

### 15. Performance Optimization
