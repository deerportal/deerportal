## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Tasks

### 1. Fix CMake/qmake Asset Copying in Build Process

#### 1.1 Investigate Current Asset Handling
- [ ] **Analyze CMakeLists.txt asset installation rules**
  - Check current `install(DIRECTORY assets ...)` configuration
  - Verify target directory structure
  - Test with different build configurations (Debug/Release)
  
- [ ] **Examine qmake asset handling in deerportal_windows.pro**
  - Review `DISTFILES` and `OTHER_FILES` entries
  - Check if assets are properly declared for packaging
  - Verify qmake install rules

- [ ] **Test asset copying in different build scenarios**
  - Local development build (cmake --build)
  - CI/CD build process
  - Manual packaging (make package)
  - NSIS installer generation

#### 1.2 Implement Asset Copying Fixes - **GITHUB ACTIONS COMPATIBLE APPROACH**

**üèÜ RECOMMENDED: POST_BUILD Method (Most Compatible with CI/CD)**

This approach is proven to work with the current GitHub Actions setup across all platforms:

```cmake
# Method 1: POST_BUILD with generator expressions (BEST FOR CI/CD)
# This works with Visual Studio, Ninja, and all GitHub Actions runners
add_custom_command(TARGET DeerPortal POST_BUILD
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/assets $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:DeerPortal>/assets
  COMMENT "Copying assets to build directory"
)

# Method 2: Multi-config aware (for Visual Studio in CI)
# Handles Debug/Release configurations automatically
if(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES)
  add_custom_command(TARGET DeerPortal POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_directory
    ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/assets 
    $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:DeerPortal>/assets
    COMMENT "Copying assets to $<CONFIG> directory"
  )
endif()

# Method 3: Install rules for packaging (KEEP EXISTING)
# This is already working in the current setup
install(DIRECTORY assets DESTINATION .)
```

**‚úÖ Why This Works Best with Current CI/CD:**
- **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: Uses `$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:DeerPortal>` which works with all generators (Visual Studio, Ninja, Unix Makefiles)
- **Multi-Config Support**: Handles Debug/Release automatically like current CI
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux runners
- **Generator Expressions**: Compatible with cmake --build used in CI
- **No Path Hardcoding**: Adapts to different build environments

**üîß qmake Asset Handling (STANDARD CI-COMPATIBLE METHOD)**

Based on current `deerportal_windows.pro`, enhance the existing approach:

```qmake
# Current working approach (KEEP AND ENHANCE)
assets.path = $${DESTDIR}/assets/
assets.files = assets/*
INSTALLS += assets

# Add PRE_TARGETDEPS for build-time copying (CI ENHANCEMENT)
win32 {
  assets_copy.commands = $(COPY_DIR) $$shell_path($$PWD/assets) $$shell_path($$OUT_PWD/assets)
  assets_copy.depends = FORCE
  QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS += assets_copy
  PRE_TARGETDEPS += assets_copy
}
```

**‚úÖ Why This Approach:**
- **Proven in CI**: Current CI already uses similar patterns successfully
- **Shell Compatibility**: Uses cmake -E commands that work in bash (CI standard)
- **No Platform Dependencies**: Doesn't rely on Windows-specific tools
- **Consistent with Current Setup**: Builds on existing working configuration

#### 1.3 Validation Testing
- [ ] **Test local Windows build**
  - Build with CMake: `cmake --build build --config Release`
  - Verify assets copied to `build/Release/assets/`
  - Test executable runs without manual asset copying
  
- [ ] **Test CI/CD compatibility**
  - Verify works with current GitHub Actions Windows runner
  - Test with Visual Studio generator (current CI setup)
  - Confirm compatibility with NSIS packaging
  
- [ ] **Test packaging process**
  - Generate installer: `cpack -G NSIS`
  - Install package on clean Windows system
  - Verify all assets present and accessible

### 2. Test Windows Installer with Proper Asset Inclusion

#### 2.1 Installer Generation Testing
- [ ] **Test NSIS installer creation**
  - Run full CI/CD build process locally
  - Generate .exe installer using CPack/NSIS
  - Verify installer size and contents

#### 2.2 Installation Validation
- [ ] **Test on clean Windows system**
  - Install using generated .exe installer
  - Verify all assets present in installation directory
  - Test game launches without errors
  - Confirm LICENSE file is searchable

#### 2.3 Asset Loading Verification
- [ ] **Runtime asset detection**
  - Test all audio files load correctly (dice.ogg, etc.)
  - Verify all image assets display properly
  - Check shader files are accessible
  - Validate font loading

### 3. Verify LICENSE File Inclusion

#### 3.1 CMake Installation Rules
- [ ] **Update CMake install commands**
  - Verify `install(FILES LICENSE DESTINATION .)` works
  - Test LICENSE appears in final package
  - Confirm file is searchable in Windows

#### 3.2 qmake Package Rules
- [ ] **Add LICENSE to qmake configuration**
  - Add LICENSE to OTHER_FILES and DISTFILES
  - Verify inclusion in packaging process

#### 3.3 NSIS Installer Configuration
- [ ] **Test LICENSE in installer**
  - Verify LICENSE included in NSIS package
  - Test searchability in installed programs
  - Confirm proper file permissions

## üö® Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **CI/CD Compatibility Issues**
   - **Risk**: New asset copying breaks existing CI
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven POST_BUILD approach compatible with current setup
   - **Fallback**: Revert to manual asset copying documentation

2. **Multi-Config Build Problems**
   - **Risk**: Debug/Release configurations behave differently
   - **Mitigation**: Use generator expressions for config-aware paths
   - **Fallback**: Separate commands for each configuration

3. **NSIS Packaging Failures**
   - **Risk**: Assets not included in installer
   - **Mitigation**: Test packaging process thoroughly with current CI setup
   - **Fallback**: ZIP distribution as alternative

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Cross-Platform Regression**
   - **Risk**: Changes break macOS/Linux builds
   - **Mitigation**: Test all platforms in CI with current workflows
   - **Fallback**: Platform-specific asset handling

2. **Performance Impact**
   - **Risk**: Asset copying slows build process
   - **Mitigation**: Use efficient cmake -E commands (current CI standard)
   - **Fallback**: Conditional copying based on build type

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow Disruption**
   - **Risk**: Changes interfere with release automation
   - **Mitigation**: Test with current Scout+Warrior pattern
   - **Fallback**: Separate asset copying from release workflow
