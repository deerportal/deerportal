## Key Technical Insights

### Performance Optimizations
- Particle system uses object pooling with 2048 particle capacity
- Trigonometry lookup tables provide O(1) sin/cos calculations
- Vertex array double buffering with dirty flag optimization
- Spatial partitioning for efficient particle culling

### Asset Management
- Multi-platform path resolution (macOS bundles, Linux AppImage, Windows)
- SafeAssetLoader provides exception-based error handling
- Texture atlas coordinates reduce memory usage
- RAII pattern ensures proper resource cleanup

### Animation Systems
- State-driven board initialization with Bezier trajectories
- Configurable animation parameters via BoardAnimationConfig
- Frame rate independent animation using delta time
- Visual effects include scaling, rotation, and staggered timing

### Audio Implementation
- Context-aware music switching based on game state
- Sound effect integration with gameplay events
- OGG Vorbis format for optimal compression and compatibility
- Streaming audio for background music, buffered audio for effects
