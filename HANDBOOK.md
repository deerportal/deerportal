# Introduction

Deer Portal is a multiplayer board game driven by the four classical
elements, designed for 0-4 players. The game takes place in an ancient
world where the Almighty Deer God protects all compassionate creatures.

## Game Objective

Transform yourself into a **Deer Lesser God** by reaching the **Hoof
Portal** and collecting the most diamonds.

## Game Philosophy

The game was inspired during a Buddhist journey through Japan,
specifically after visiting T≈çdai-ji temple in Nara. The mission is to
spread the word about the Deer through this strategic gameplay.

# Game Setup

## Classical Elements

The gameboard is divided into four areas, each controlled by one
classical element:

- [**Water**]{style="color: waterblue"} (Blue) - Represents flow,
  adaptation, and change

- [**Earth**]{style="color: earthgreen"} (Green) - Represents stability,
  growth, and foundation

- [**Fire**]{style="color: firered"} (Red) - Represents energy,
  transformation, and passion

- [**Air**]{style="color: airyellow"} (Yellow) - Represents freedom,
  intellect, and movement

## Players

Each of the four players is mentored by one classical element and can:

- Move around their designated board area

- Collect runes and diamonds

- Meditate to receive help from their patron element

- Reach the Deer Portal for transformation

Players can be controlled by humans or computers, allowing for various
gameplay configurations.

## How to Play

### Turn Structure
Each active player (who hasn't reached the portal yet, nor is frozen) performs two actions during their turn:

1. **Roll the Dice** - Click on the dice symbol in the bottom right area
2. **Choose Movement** - Click on the corresponding area on your board to move your character

### Field Effects
After moving your character, depending on the destination field you may:

- **Collect Diamonds** - If there was one on the field (+1 cash)
- **Activate Cards** - If a rune was on the field (execute card effect)
- **Meditate** - If the field was your starting place (regenerate your area)
- **Enter Portal** - Move to the Deer God kingdom (end game trigger)

# Card System

The heart of Deer Portal's strategy lies in its sophisticated card
system. Each element maintains a deck of 32 cards that provide powerful
interactions between players.

## Card Activation Rules

1.  **Own Element Runes**: When landing on your own element's rune, the
    card is discarded and the next card is revealed

2.  **Other Element Runes**: When landing on another element's rune, the
    card effect executes against that element's area

3.  **Targeting Restriction**: You cannot use cards against your own
    element area

4.  **Deck Progression**: After each card use, the deck advances to the
    next card

5.  **Deck Exhaustion**: When a deck runs out, that element pile becomes
    inactive

3.  **Stop Cards** - Tactical disruption tool

4.  **Remove Cards** - Situational utility option

## Timing Strategies

- **Early Game**: Focus on diamond cards for resource building

- **Mid Game**: Deploy stop cards against leading players

- **Late Game**: Use remove cards to eliminate threats before portal
  entry

## Element Targeting

Consider these factors when choosing targets:

- Visible resource density in target areas

- Strategic position of controlling players

- Current game state and remaining turns

- Deck status of different elements

# Special Game Mechanics

## Meditation System

Returning to your starting position with an exact dice roll triggers
meditation, which:

- Regenerates all diamonds and cards in your area

- Requires precise dice roll calculation

- Provides strategic reset opportunity

- Essential for long-term resource management

## Deck Exhaustion Effects

When element decks become empty:

- Deck becomes inactive (no more cards can be drawn)

- All remaining resources of that element are removed from the board

- Element becomes strategically less valuable

- Affects long-term game balance

## Deer Mode

When the first player reaches the portal:

- **Deer Mode** begins (4 rounds - one turn per player)

- First player gets bonus diamonds for reaching first

- All remaining players must reach portal before Deer Mode ends

- Players who don't reach portal in time are eliminated

# Victory Conditions

## Primary Victory

The player with the most diamonds when all players reach the portal (or
deer mode ends) wins the game.

## Tiebreaker

In case of diamond count ties, victory goes to the player who reached
the portal first.

## Transformation

- **Winner**: Transforms into a Deer God

- **Survivors**: Become devoted monks spreading the philosophy

- **Eliminated**: Become the foundation of the new philosophy
